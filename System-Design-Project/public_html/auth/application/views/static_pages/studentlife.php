            You should make memories that last a lifetime in college. We are dedicated to this idea, not in spite of our scholarly mission, but as a complement to it. Boredom and learning simply are not compatible. This may be our strongest argument for the nearly 50 clubs and organizations on our campus, for the hundreds of hours of entertainment, athletic events and social programming that go on every semester, and for giving our Student Association, created "by the students and to serve the students," an annual budget of over $ 2 million.
