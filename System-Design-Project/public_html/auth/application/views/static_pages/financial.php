        <p>       The counselors and staff in the SUNY TECH Financial Aid Office work hard
            to make sure all qualified students have the opportunity to pursue a post-secondary
            education. A variety of forms of assistance are available to families whose resources
            are inadequate to meet the full cost of education.
            Financial aid comes in three forms: loans, grants, and work-study programs.</p>
