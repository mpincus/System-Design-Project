            <p> SUNY TECH has a growing reputation for providing an exceptional educational experience at
                an affordable cost. In addition to frequent recognition by national organizations for our
                academic quality and commitment to student engagement, we have been named to the Strong nation
                magazine </p>
            <p>list of the 50 Best Values in Public Colleges for 8 years running.
                We recognize that paying for college can be a challenge for many families,
                and the staff in our Financial Aid Office works hard to connect students
                with resources that can help. Fully 80 percent of SUNY TECH students
                receive some form of financial assistance, and we awarded $2 million in
                scholarships last year.</p>
