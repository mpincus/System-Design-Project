<h1>Academics</h1>

<p>To understand how deeply we care about academics, look no further than the college's mission statement. It's just one sentence long, but it speaks volumes:</p>

    <p>SUNY TECH unites excellence in teaching, scholarship, civic engagement, and stewardship to create a student-centered learning community.</p>

    <p>Our determination to provide a stimulating, rigorous environment and hands-on, high-impact learning has made TECH a premier school within the SUNY system. This is also why we tend to attract students and teachers who want small classes, undergraduate research opportunities, and plenty of student-faculty interaction.</p>
