<h3>Residency Requirements</h3>
<p>For tuition billing purposes, mere presence in New York State does not in itself constitute legal residence in the state. Stude
nts who
are defi ned as New York State residents are those who, prior to the beginning of the semester, have established a permanent dom
icile
in New York State for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the date of registration.
Students in college cannot gain residential status unless they can establish that their previous domicile has been abandoned an
d a new
one established in New York for purposes other than attending the University. Proof of domicile is based on intention to remain in
New York State. Factors relevant in determining domicile are: residence of parents (in case of unemancipated students), proof
of financial independence, residence for personal income tax purposes, etc. An unemancipated studentâ€™s domicile is that of the pare
nt or legal guardian. Any student claiming emancipation to establish a domicile in New York must submit evidence of emancipation</p>
